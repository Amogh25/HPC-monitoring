Review comments:
1. Add steps on how you went about setting up Kafka, Prometheus, Node Exporter and Grafana for your project.
2. Add step on the starting the kafka - This will be required for demonstrating the simulator.
3. Add steps on starting the selenium test - This will be required for validating the tests.
4. Require the list of PASS and FAIL conditions that you are testing - Keep this list as active so that you know how you are progressing.
