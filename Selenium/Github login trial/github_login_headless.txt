 - Using selenium IDE record web interactions and export code
 - Using these scripts we can playback tests to manually step through repititive tasks
 - To avoid consuming screen time and slow-rendering of the user interface these tests are run in a headless mode
 - code:
       op = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
       op.add_argument('headless')
       driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=op)
